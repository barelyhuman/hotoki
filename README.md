Codename: hotoki

## Path
1. Plain Text Editor (WIP)
2. Markdown Editor 
3. Code Editor

hotoki aims to be minimal and the above is the path it'll follow during development. 
It'll start off by being a plain text editor and evolve to a Markdown editor and then aim to be a code editor. 

## Why another Editor?

I don't need to answer that but I'll just say that I'm doing it for personal usage. I prefer using tools that I build and hence this. Will someday setup a git server too, don't worry about it.
